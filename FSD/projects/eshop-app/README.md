## **Project Title:** ShopEase â€” A Simple E-Commerce Web Application

## **Tech Stack:** React (Frontend) + Spring Boot (Backend)

---

## **1. Problem Statement**

In todayâ€™s digital marketplace, customers expect to browse and purchase products online quickly and securely. Small and mid-sized retailers often struggle to build reliable, modern, and easy-to-maintain e-commerce platforms due to limited technical expertise and resources.

**ShopEase** aims to solve this problem by developing a **simple and modular e-commerce web application** using **React** for the user interface and **Spring Boot** for backend microservices.
The application will demonstrate fundamental e-commerce features such as:

* Browsing a product catalog
* Viewing product details
* Adding items to a shopping cart
* User authentication and order placement
* Basic admin panel for product management

The project emphasizes **clean architecture**, **RESTful APIs**, and **frontendâ€“backend integration**, providing learners with hands-on experience in **full-stack development** and **microservice communication**.

## **2. Project Scope (Simplified)**

### âœ… **In-Scope Features**

#### **Frontend (React)**

* User registration and login forms
* Product listing and product details pages
* Shopping cart management (add/remove items)
* Checkout page (order summary + place order)
* Admin view for adding or editing products
* Responsive design using Bootstrap or Tailwind

#### **Backend (Spring Boot)**

* REST APIs for:

  * User authentication (JWT based)
  * Product management (CRUD)
  * Cart and order management
* Product and order persistence in MySQL/PostgreSQL
* Role-based access control (User/Admin)
* Integration with frontend via JSON APIs

---

### ðŸš« **Out of Scope (for simplicity)**

* Payment gateway integration
* Shipping, inventory, and analytics modules
* External authentication (Google/Facebook login)
* Microservice decomposition (use 2â€“3 simple services instead)
* Cloud deployment (optional stretch goal)

---

## **3. Objectives**

1. Build a simple yet complete full-stack e-commerce system using modern frameworks.
2. Understand RESTful API design and secure communication between React and Spring Boot.
3. Demonstrate database operations, authentication, and session management.
4. Apply component-based UI development and responsive web design.
5. Gain practical exposure to integrating frontend and backend layers.

## **5. Expected Deliverables**

* Functional **React frontend** connected to **Spring Boot APIs**
* Well-defined REST endpoints (`/api/products`, `/api/users`, `/api/cart`, `/api/orders`)
* Database schema (users, products, orders, cart tables)
* API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI recommended)
* Final report including:

  * Architecture diagram
  * ER diagram
  * Screenshots of UI
  * Summary of challenges and learning outcomes

---

## **6. Success Criteria**

* âœ… Application runs successfully on localhost with end-to-end flow.
* âœ… Users can register, log in, browse products, add to cart, and place an order.
* âœ… Admin can manage product catalog.
* âœ… Clean UI and properly working REST APIs with validation and error handling.
* âœ… Code is modular, readable, and well-documented.
